                        <strong>Albert Bierstadt (January 7, 1830 – February 18, 1902)</strong></span> was a
                    German-American painter best known for his lavish, sweeping
                    landscapes of the American West. To paint the scenes, Bierstadt joined several journeys of the
                    Westward Expansion. Though not the first artist to record these sites, Bierstadt was the foremost
                    painter of these scenes for the remainder of the 19th century.</p>

                <p>
                    Born in Prussia, Bierstadt was brought to the United States at the age of one by his parents. He
                    later returned to study painting for several years in Düsseldorf. He became part of the Hudson River
                    School in New York, an informal group of like-minded painters who started painting along the Hudson
                    River. Their style was based on carefully detailed paintings with romantic, almost glowing lighting,
                    sometimes called luminism. An important interpreter of the western landscape, Bierstadt, along with
                    Thomas Moran, is also grouped with the Rocky Mountain School.

                        class="text-primary"><strong>Winslow Homer (February 24, 1836 – September 29,
                            1910)</strong></span> was an American landscape painter and printmaker, best known for his
                    marine subjects. He is considered one of the foremost painters in 19th-century America and a
                    preeminent figure in American art.</p>

                <p>
                    Largely self-taught, Homer began his career working as a commercial illustrator. He subsequently
                    took up oil painting and produced major studio works characterized by the weight and density he
                    exploited from the medium. He also worked extensively in watercolor, creating a fluid and prolific
                    oeuvre, primarily chronicling his working vacations.</p>

                            1926)</strong></span>
                    was an American painter and printmaker. She was born in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania (Now part of
                    Pittsburgh's North Side), but lived much of her adult life in France, where she first befriended
                    Edgar Degas and later exhibited among the Impressionists. Cassatt often created images of the social
                    and private lives of women, with particular emphasis on the intimate bonds between mothers and
                    children.</p>

                <p>
                    She was described by Gustave Geffroy in 1894 as one of "les trois grandes dames" (the three great
                    ladies) of Impressionism alongside Marie Bracquemond and Berthe Morisot.</p>

                        class="text-primary"><strong>James Abbott McNeill Whistler (July 11, 1834 – July 17,
                            1903)</strong></span>
                    was an American artist, active during the American Gilded Age and based primarily in the United
                    Kingdom. He was averse to sentimentality and moral allusion in painting, and was a leading proponent
                    of the credo "art for art's sake". His famous signature for his paintings was in the shape of a
                    stylized butterfly possessing a long stinger for a tail. The symbol was apt, for it combined both
                    aspects of his personality: his art is characterized by a subtle delicacy, while his public persona
                    was combative. He found a parallel between painting and music and entitled many of his paintings
                    "arrangements", "harmonies", and "nocturnes", emphasizing the primacy of tonal harmony. His most
                    famous painting is Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1 (1871), commonly known as Whistler's Mother,
                    the revered and often parodied portrait of motherhood. Whistler influenced the art world and the
                    broader culture of his time with his artistic theories and his friendships with leading artists and
                    writers.

                                1963)</strong></span> was an American poet. His work was initially
                        published in England before it was published in America. Known for his realistic depictions of
                        rural
                        life and his command of American colloquial speech, Frost frequently wrote about settings from
                        rural
                        life in New England in the early twentieth century, using them to examine complex social and
                        philosophical themes.</p>

                    <p>
                        Frost was honored frequently during his lifetime, receiving four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. He
                        became
                        one of America's rare "public literary figures, almost an artistic institution." He was awarded
                        the
                        Congressional Gold Medal in 1960 for his poetic works. On July 22, 1961, Frost was named poet
                        laureate
                        of Vermont.</p>

                <div id="dickinson" class="collapse">
                    <p><span class="text-primary"><strong>Emily Elizabeth Dickinson (December 10, 1830 – May 15,
                                1886)</strong></span> was an American poet.
                        Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts into a prominent family with strong ties to its
                        community.
                        After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the
                        Mount
                        Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst.
                        Some argue that Dickinson lived much of her life in reclusive isolation. Considered an eccentric
                        by
                        locals, she developed a noted penchant for white clothing and became known for her reluctance to
                        greet
                        guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most
                        friendships
                        between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.[2]</p>

                    <p>
                        While Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly 1,800 poems were
                        published
                        during her lifetime. The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered
                        significantly
                        by the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time. Her poems are unique for the
                        era
                        in
                        which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as
                        well
                        as
                        unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and
                        immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.</p>

                    <p><span class="text-primary"><strong>Walter "Walt" Whitman ( May 31, 1819 – March 26,
                                1892)</strong></span> was an American poet, essayist, and journalist. A
                        humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating
                        both
                        views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often
                        called
                        the
                        father of free verse.His work was very controversial in its time, particularly his poetry
                        collection
                        Leaves of Grass, which was described as obscene for its overt sexuality.</p>

                    <p> Born in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, a government
                        clerk,
                        and—in
                        addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in
                        his
                        career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842). Whitman's major work, Leaves
                        of
                        Grass, was first published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out
                        to
                        the
                        common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in
                        1892.
                        After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health
                        further
                        declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle.</p>
