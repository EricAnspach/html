            <p><strong>Robert Lee Frost</strong> (March 26, 1874 – January 29, 1963) was an American poet. His work was
                initially published in England before it was published in America. Known for his realistic depictions of
                rural life and his command of American colloquial speech, Frost frequently wrote about settings from
                rural life in New England in the early twentieth century, using them to examine complex social and
                philosophical themes.</p>

            <p>Frost was honored frequently during his lifetime, receiving four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. He became
                one of America's rare "public literary figures, almost an artistic institution." He was awarded the
                Congressional Gold Medal in 1960 for his poetic works. On July 22, 1961, Frost was named poet laureate
                of Vermont.</p>

            <h5>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h5>

            <p> Whose woods these are I think I know.
                His house is in the village though;
                He will not see me stopping here
                To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>

            <p> My little horse must think it queer
                To stop without a farmhouse near
                Between the woods and frozen lake
                The darkest evening of the year.</p>

            <p> He gives his harness bells a shake
                To ask if there is some mistake.
                The only other sound’s the sweep
                Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>

            <p> The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
                But I have promises to keep,
                And miles to go before I sleep,
                And miles to go before I sleep.</p></em>

            <p><strong>Emily Elizabeth Dickinson</strong> (December 10, 1830 – May 15, 1886) was an American poet.</p>

            <p>Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts into a prominent family with strong ties to its community.
                After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount
                Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst.</p>

            <p>Some argue that Dickinson lived much of her life in reclusive isolation. Considered an eccentric by
                locals, she developed a noted penchant for white clothing and became known for her reluctance to greet
                guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships
                between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.</p>

            <p>While Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly 1,800 poems were published
                during her lifetime. The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered significantly
                by the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time. Her poems are unique for the era in
                which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as
                unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and
                immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.</p>

            <em><p>They shut me up in Prose –
                As when a little Girl
                They put me in the Closet –
                Because they liked me "still" –</p>

            <p> Still! Could themself have peeped –
                And seen my Brain – go round –
                They might as wise have lodged a Bird
                For Treason – in the Pound –</p></em>

            <p><strong>Walter "Walt" Whitman</strong> ( May 31, 1819 – March 26, 1892) was an American poet,essayist,
                and journalist. A humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism,
                incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American
                canon, often called the father of free verse.His work was very controversial in its time, particularly
                his poetry collection Leaves of Grass, which was described as obscene for its overt sexuality.</p>

            <p>Born in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, a government clerk, and—in
                addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in his
                career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842). Whitman's major work, Leaves of
                Grass, was first published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the
                common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892.
                After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further
                declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle.</p>

            <p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
                The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
                The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
                While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
                But O heart! heart! heart!
                O the bleeding drops of red,
                Where on the deck my Captain lies,
                Fallen cold and dead.</p>

            <p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
                Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,
                For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
                For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
                Here Captain! dear father!
                This arm beneath your head!
                It is some dream that on the deck,
                You’ve fallen cold and dead.</p>

            <p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
                My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
                The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
                From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
                Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
                But I with mournful tread,
                Walk the deck my Captain lies,
                Fallen cold and dead.</p></em>
