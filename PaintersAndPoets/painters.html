            <p><strong>Albert Bierstadt</strong> (January 7, 1830 – February 18, 1902) was a German-American painter
                best known
                for his lavish, sweeping landscapes of the American West. To paint the scenes, Bierstadt joined several
                journeys
                of the Westward Expansion. Though not the first artist to record these sites, Bierstadt was the foremost
                painter
                of these scenes for the remainder of the 19th century.</p>

            <p>Born in Prussia, Bierstadt was brought to the United States at the age of one by his parents. He later
                returned
                to study painting for several years in Düsseldorf. He became part of the Hudson River School in New
                York, an
                informal group of like-minded painters who started painting along the Hudson River. Their style was
                based on
                carefully detailed paintings with romantic, almost glowing lighting, sometimes called <em>luminism</em>.
                An important
                interpreter of the western landscape, Bierstadt, along with Thomas Moran, is also grouped with the Rocky
                Mountain School.</p>

            <p><strong>Winslow Homer</strong> (February 24, 1836 – September 29, 1910) was an American landscape painter
                and
                printmaker, best known for his marine subjects. He is considered one of the foremost painters in
                19th-century
                America and a preeminent figure in American art.</p>

            <p>Largely self-taught, Homer began his career working as a commercial illustrator. He subsequently took up
                oil painting and produced major studio works characterized by the weight and density he exploited from the
                medium.
                He also worked extensively in watercolor, creating a fluid and prolific oeuvre, primarily chronicling
                his
                working vacations.</p>

            <p><strong>Mary Stevenson Cassatt</strong> (May 22, 1844 – June 14, 1926) was an American painter and
                printmaker.
                She was born in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania (Now part of Pittsburgh's North Side), but lived much of
                her adult
                life in France, where she first befriended Edgar Degas and later exhibited among the Impressionists.
                Cassatt
                often created images of the social and private lives of women, with particular emphasis on the intimate
                bonds
                between mothers and children.</p>

            <p>She was described by Gustave Geffroy in 1894 as one of "les trois grandes dames" (the three great ladies)
                of
                Impressionism alongside Marie Bracquemond and Berthe Morisot.</p>

            <p><strong>James Abbott McNeill Whistler</strong> (July 11, 1834 – July 17, 1903) was an American artist,
                active
                during the American Gilded Age and based primarily in the United Kingdom. He was averse to
                sentimentality and
                moral allusion in painting, and was a leading proponent of the credo "art for art's sake". His famous
                signature
                for his paintings was in the shape of a stylized butterfly possessing a long stinger for a tail. The
                symbol was
                apt, for it combined both aspects of his personality: his art is characterized by a subtle delicacy,
                while his
                public persona was combative. He found a parallel between painting and music and entitled many of his
                paintings
                "arrangements", "harmonies", and "nocturnes", emphasizing the primacy of tonal harmony. His most famous
                painting
                is <em>Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1</em> (1871), commonly known as <em>Whistler's Mother</em>,
                the revered and often
                parodied portrait of motherhood. Whistler influenced the art world and the broader culture of his time
                with his
                artistic theories and his friendships with leading artists and writers.</p>
